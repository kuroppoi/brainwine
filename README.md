Brainwine is a Deepworld private server written in Java, designed to be portable and easy to use.\
It's still a work in progress, so keep in mind that it's not yet feature-complete. (A to-do list can be found [here](https://github.com/kuroppoi/brainwine/projects/1).)\
Brainwine currently supports the following versions of Deepworld:

- Windows: `v3.13.1`
- iOS: `v2.11.0.1`
- MacOS: `v2.11.1`

## Quick Local Setup

- Install [Java 8](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?package=jdk&version=8).
- Download the [latest Brainwine release](https://github.com/kuroppoi/brainwine/releases/latest).
- Start Brainwine by running the jar file.
- In the window that appears, press "Start Server" to start the server.
- Press "Start Deepworld" to launch the game.
  - If you want to play on iOS, download a patching kit for it [here](https://github.com/kuroppoi/brainwine/releases/tag/patching-kits-1.0).
- Register a new account and play the game.

## Building

### Prerequisites

- Java 8 Development Kit

Run the following to build the program:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/kuroppoi/brainwine.git
cd brainwine
./gradlew dist
```

The output executable jar `brainwine.jar` will be located in the `/build/dist` directory.\
To start the server without a user interface, run the following:

```sh
# This behavior is the default on platforms that do not support Java's Desktop API.
java -jar brainwine.jar disablegui
```

## Docker

Run the following to build the image:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kuroppoi/brainwine
cd brainwine
docker buildx build -t brainwine:latest .
```

To then run the image in a container, run the following:

```sh
# Replace ${PWD} with %cd% if you're using a Windows Command Prompt.
docker run -p 5001-5003:5001-5003 --volume ${PWD}/run:/data brainwine:latest
```

Or alternatively, if you wish to use docker compose:

```sh
docker compose up
```

The server files will be stored in a docker volume and can be accessed from `/data` in the container.\
Feel free to play around with the configuration by editing `docker-compose.yml`.
